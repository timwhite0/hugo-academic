I'm a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan. I work with [Jeff Regier](https://regier.stat.lsa.umich.edu) on developing scalable Bayesian methods and applying them to problems in the physical sciences, namely astrophysics. My work involves a combination of Monte Carlo methods and machine learning. I also help teach courses about data mining, statistical modeling, and Bayesian inference.
